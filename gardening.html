                <h2>What will I need</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strawberry plants. Plants are available from garden centers in spring, plants can also be gotten
                        online.</li>
                    <li>Pots. Pots should be at least 8-12" in diameter and 8 inches deep, alternatively you could use a
                        Strawberry planter or a hanging basket.</li>
                    <li>Soil. Strawberries like drainage so you could put some gravel in the end of your container to
                        help, A rich sandy soil is ideal or a
                        multi purpose compost will do fine.</li>
                    <li>A garden bed.
                    </li>
                    <li>Fertaliser. Horse manure or chicken manure either can be gotten from gerden centers in
                        dehydrated form.</li>
                    <li>Feed. many organic feeds will be available in garden centres.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>What will I do</h2>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            If you choose to use manure you will need about a handful for each plant, this will be
                            adequate for
                            three months worth of nutrition.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add the compost to the pot or garden bed and make a hole in it big enough to fit the roots
                            of the
                            strawberry plant, about 170mm or 6 to 8 inches deep.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cover over the roots with soil about 6mm deep or 1/4 inch.
                            <br>
                            If you are planting the Strawbirry plants in a bed they should be spaced about 400mm or 18
                            inches
                            apart to allow space for runners.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Runners are daughter plants, when runners are coming from your plants you can pin them to a
                            new pot
                            of soil and when they grow roots you can cut the umbilical cord ready for next year or if
                            you do it
                            early enough and leave the umbilical cord attached you may see them fruit the same year.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Make sure your plants get plenty of water, In warm weather you may need to water them every
                            day.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you choose to give them food, you should find a schedule on the packaging.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
